Hello i'm based on [Haruka Aya](https://t.me/HarukaAyaBot), a modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Can be found on telegram as [Ｈｉｔｓｕｋｉ](https://t.me/LordHitsuki_BOT).

You can also join official Haruka Aya support group [here!](https://t.me/HarukaAyaBot)
(Remember that they do not support any Haruka Aya fork.)
